Elected into office after a hard fought battle with that bitch Hillary Clinton.
His first action as president was to send Vladimir Putin, the leader of russia,
a 5 hour video of him making funny fart noises with his mouth.
Putin did not agree with this form of communication. 

This was the start of the most disastrous display of power the 
world has ever experienced.

It is all up to you, Mr secretary of defense.....Win this war.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!! 


In this game you are in control of the United States nuclear and inventory. 
You are to take turns playing against a A.I. in a battle between Russia and the 
United States. 

Each country has its weaponry spread across their country located near cities.
Take out Russian cities to take out its nuclear supply. Each county starts out with 
 60 nuclear missiles spread out in its top 20 largest cities.

Each turn you get to choose which russian city you would
 like to attack. You will then shoot 2 missiles at the chosen city,
destroying both its population and nuclear armorings. 
Some cities will have more nukes than others, and some none
at all, so be careful 
On which ones to shoot. This winner is either whoever destroys each
 other first or which one runs out of missiles.
