# ColdWarAbriged
comp sci project
Hello, to run this game you need to download the following files:
coldwarFistGameType.PvP (save as .java)
cities.txt (save as .txt)
WarText.txt (save as .txt)
City.java (save as .java)

Once you have these please open coldwarFistGameType.PvP and save it as ColdWar2.java. The rest let them save as teh names given here.
The game will give you a opining text. You may choose to read it or forget it. It will then prompt you for a russian city. Due to time limitations I havent been able to give a call for the list of names. The best way to see are to open the cities.txt file and the 
first 20 will be russian and the next 20 will be united states citys.

the diffrent russianHeath, unitedHealth, unitedNuke are all garbage classes that I had made before scrapping them. the reason i leave them is becasue It shows where some of the seemingly lost time has gone. I really struggled with the concept of classes and objects fo rthe mojority of this program. but in the last couple of weeks it clicked and this is the outcome tht i have gotten from these few days of understanding what i am doing.

The file named ColdWar2.Not Complete. Does not run.Player Vs. A.I. is a version that i was workign on to make a A.I. playing as ruissia.
I didnt get this finished in tiem but it shows what i have been working on the past couple of days.
